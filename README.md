# Heknot

A privacy-focused personal health ecosystem for tracking weight, workouts, nutrition, and wellness habits. Heknot is designed to operate entirely on-device, prioritizing data sovereignty and offline functionality.

## Core Principles

- **Data Sovereignty:** All health data remains on the physical device. There is no cloud synchronization, external telemetry, or mandatory account creation.
- **Offline Infrastructure:** The application is architected to be fully functional without internet connectivity, ensuring reliability in any environment.
- **Technical Transparency:** The project is open-source, allowing for full auditability of data handling and storage processes.

## Features

- **Weight Analytics:** Log body metrics and visualize trends through high-fidelity interactive charts.
- **Workout Management:** Categorized exercise library with support for strength and cardio routine tracking.
- **Nutrition Logging:** On-device calorie and macronutrient monitoring.
- **Habit Tracking:** Consistency monitoring for daily wellness targets, including hydration and activity streaks.

## Tech Stack

- **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose with Material 3 design system.
- **Language:** Kotlin 2.1.0.
- **Visualization:** Vico charting library.
- **Persistence:** Room Database (SQLite) for structured local storage.

## Project Context

Heknot is part of the Guada Labs initiative, focused on building user-centric, decentralized software.
